# Flowers-For-Gale

The theme for the game jam was "Gust".

The game was made completely within 48 hours by two artists and one programmer, none of whom had published a game before.

The programming was done completely by me in Game Maker Studio, a program I had never used prior to the gamejam. This was far and away the biggest limitation on our project, and something that will be very improved in future projects.
